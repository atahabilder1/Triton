# Triton: Multi-Modal Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection

**Presentation Date**: October 30, 2025
**Current Status**: Training Phase - Improving Detection Accuracy

---

## Slide 1: Project Overview

**Triton** - A multi-modal AI system for detecting vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts

**Novel Contributions**:
1. Multi-modal fusion (Static + Dynamic + Semantic analysis)
2. Agentic orchestration with iterative refinement
3. Cross-attention mechanism for modality fusion

**Target**: Outperform existing tools (Slither, Mythril, SmartCheck)

**3 Encoders** → **Fusion** → **Orchestrator** → **Prediction**

## Slide 3: Initial State (Yesterday)

**Status**: System implemented but untrained

**Detection Rate**: 0%
- All components present
- Models initialized with random weights
- No actual learning yet

**Issue**: Need training to learn vulnerability patterns

---

## Slide 4: First Training Attempt

**Training Setup**:
- Dataset: SmartBugs Curated (143 contracts)
- Epochs: 5
- Batch Size: 4
- Device: CUDA GPU

**Training Results**:
- Semantic Encoder: 37.93% validation accuracy
- Fusion Module: 51.72% validation accuracy
- Models saved successfully (~1.5GB)

---

## Slide 5: Problem Discovered

**Testing showed 0% detection again!**

**Root Causes Found**:
1. Models trained but test script didn't load them
2. Orchestrator used zero tensors instead of encoder outputs
3. Vulnerability type tracking was broken

**All models were initialized fresh each time = random guessing**

---

## Slide 6: Fixes Applied (Today Morning)

**Fix 1**: Updated test script to load trained checkpoints
```python
# Before: Always random weights
self.semantic_encoder = SemanticEncoder(...)

# After: Load trained weights
self._load_checkpoints()  # Loads from models/checkpoints/
```

**Fix 2**: Orchestrator now uses actual encoder outputs
```python
# Before: Zero tensors
static_tensor = torch.zeros(1, 768)

# After: Real features
semantic_features, vuln_scores = self.semantic_encoder([source_code])
```

---

## Slide 7: First Real Results

**Detection Rate**: 12.59% (18/143 contracts detected)

**Breakthrough**: Access Control vulnerabilities detected perfectly!

| Vulnerability Type | Total | Detected | Rate |
|-------------------|-------|----------|------|
| Access Control | 18 | 18 | **100%** ✅ |
| Arithmetic | 15 | 0 | 0% |
| Reentrancy | 31 | 0 | 0% |
| Unchecked Calls | 52 | 0 | 0% |
| Others | 27 | 0 | 0% |

**Progress**: 0% → 12.59% in one day

---

## Slide 8: Analysis of Results

**Why only Access Control works?**

Model predicts `access_control` for 97% of contracts (139/143)

**Root Cause**: Severe class imbalance
- Training data has uneven distribution
- Model learned to always predict majority class
- Confidence scores all ~0.50 (essentially random)

**Additional Problem**: Data leakage
- Trained on 143 contracts
- Tested on same 143 contracts
- Not publishable methodology

---

## Slide 9: Current Approach (In Progress)

**Solution**: Train on FORGE, Test on SmartBugs

**FORGE Dataset**: 78,228 contracts with vulnerability labels
**SmartBugs**: 143 contracts as held-out test set

**Key Improvements**:
1. **Class-weighted loss** - Penalizes minority class errors more
2. **Balanced sampling** - Equal representation in each batch
3. **More epochs** - 20 instead of 5
4. **Proper train/test split** - No data leakage

---

## Slide 10: Training Strategy

**Phase 1**: Semantic Encoder Fine-tuning
- GraphCodeBERT on vulnerability detection
- Lower learning rate (0.0001)
- AdamW optimizer with weight decay

**Phase 2**: Fusion Module Training
- All encoders jointly optimized
- Different learning rates per component
- End-to-end vulnerability classification

**Class Weights** computed from training distribution:
```
access_control: 0.85x
reentrancy: 0.95x
arithmetic: 1.2x
(higher weight = more penalty for mistakes)
```

---

## Slide 11: Expected Improvements

**Current Baseline**: 12.59% F1 score

**After Class Weighting**: 25-35% F1 score
- Better balance across vulnerability types
- Still limited by small training data

**After FORGE Training**: 40-60% F1 score
- Learn from 78K contracts
- Much better generalization
- Proper test methodology

**Target for Publication**: 50-70% F1 score
- Competitive with state-of-the-art
- Novel multi-modal approach
- Demonstrated improvements

---

## Slide 12: State-of-the-Art Comparison

**Existing Tools Performance**:

| Tool | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Slither | 30-40% | 50-60% | ~40% |
| Mythril | 40-50% | 30-40% | ~38% |
| SmartCheck | 60-70% | 40-50% | ~52% |
| **Triton (Current)** | 12.6% | 12.6% | **12.6%** |
| **Triton (Target)** | 55-65% | 50-60% | **55%+** |

**Gap**: Need 40+ percentage points improvement

**Timeline**: 2-3 hours FORGE training + testing

## Slide 13: Technical Innovations

**1. Multi-Modal Fusion**
- Most tools use single analysis method
- We combine 3 complementary approaches
- Cross-attention learns optimal weighting

**2. Agentic Orchestration**
- Iterative refinement based on confidence
- Adapts analysis depth per contract
- RL-based decision making

**3. Vulnerability-Specific Embeddings**
- Each vulnerability type has learned representation
- Semantic encoder has 10 specialized heads
- Better discrimination between classes

---

## Slide 14: Next Steps & Timeline

**Immediate** (Tonight):
- Fix FORGE dataset loader path issue
- Start full training run (3-4 hours)

**Tomorrow Morning**:
- Test trained models on SmartBugs
- Generate performance comparison report
- Analyze per-class improvements

**This Week**:
- Fine-tune hyperparameters if needed
- Run ablation studies (impact of each modality)
- Prepare results for paper/thesis
