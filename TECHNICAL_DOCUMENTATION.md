# Triton: Multi-Modal Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection System

**Technical Documentation**
Last Updated: October 30, 2025 - Evening

**Current Status**: Working system with 12.59% F1 score, ready for improved training

---

## System Overview

Triton is a multi-modal AI system that combines static analysis, dynamic analysis, and semantic understanding to detect vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts. The system uses three specialized neural network encoders, a cross-modal fusion mechanism, and an agentic orchestrator for iterative refinement.

### Core Components

1. **Static Encoder** - Graph Attention Network (GAT) operating on Program Dependency Graphs (PDG)
2. **Dynamic Encoder** - LSTM network analyzing execution traces
3. **Semantic Encoder** - Fine-tuned GraphCodeBERT for code understanding
4. **Cross-Modal Fusion** - Attention-based mechanism combining all three modalities
5. **Agentic Orchestrator** - RL-based system for adaptive analysis depth

---

## Architecture Details

### Static Encoder (GAT on PDG)

**Input**: Program Dependency Graph with control and data flow
**Architecture**:
- 3-layer Graph Attention Network
- Node features: 128-dim
- Hidden dimensions: 256
- Output: 768-dim vulnerability-aware representation

**Key Features**:
- Multi-head attention (8 heads)
- Residual connections
- Layer normalization
- Captures structural patterns in code

### Dynamic Encoder (LSTM on Traces)

**Input**: Execution trace sequences from symbolic execution
**Architecture**:
- 2-layer Bidirectional LSTM
- Embedding dim: 128
- Hidden dim: 256
- Output: 512-dim temporal representation

**Key Features**:
- Bidirectional processing
- Attention over timesteps
- Captures runtime behavior patterns
- Detects reentrancy and race conditions

### Semantic Encoder (GraphCodeBERT)

**Base Model**: microsoft/graphcodebert-base (125M parameters)
**Fine-tuning Strategy**:
- Lower learning rate (0.0001) to preserve pre-trained knowledge
- Vulnerability-specific embedding layer (10 classes × 64 dims)
- 10 specialized classification heads (one per vulnerability type)
- Projection layer: 768 → 768

**Preprocessing**:
- Remove comments
- Normalize whitespace
- Highlight security-critical keywords
- Max length: 512 tokens

**Vulnerability Heads**:
Each vulnerability type has a dedicated 3-layer MLP:
```
Input (768) → ReLU → Dropout(0.1) →
384 → ReLU →
192 → Sigmoid →
Output (1)
```

### Cross-Modal Fusion

**Mechanism**: Multi-head cross-attention with adaptive weighting

**Input Dimensions**:
- Static: 768
- Dynamic: 512
- Semantic: 768

**Architecture**:
1. Dimension alignment (project all to 768)
2. Cross-attention between modality pairs
3. Adaptive weight learning per modality
4. Residual fusion with skip connections
5. Final projection to 10-class logits

**Adaptive Weighting**:
```python
weights = softmax(MLP([static, dynamic, semantic]))
fused = weights[0] * static + weights[1] * dynamic + weights[2] * semantic
```

Learns which modality to trust based on contract characteristics.

### Agentic Orchestrator

**Analysis Phases**:
1. INITIAL - Quick multi-modal scan
2. DEEP_STATIC - Detailed PDG analysis with Slither
3. DEEP_DYNAMIC - Symbolic execution with Mythril
4. DEEP_SEMANTIC - Intensive code pattern matching
5. REFINEMENT - Ensemble and cross-validation
6. FINAL - Confidence-weighted decision

**Decision Logic**:
- Continue if confidence < vulnerability-specific threshold
- Stop if max iterations reached (default: 5)
- Adapt next phase based on modality contributions

**Confidence Evaluator**:
- Separate network estimating prediction uncertainty
- Calibrates confidence using epistemic uncertainty
- Triggers deeper analysis when uncertain

## Training Methodology

### Current Status (October 30, 2025)

**Baseline Training** (Completed):
- Dataset: SmartBugs Curated (143 contracts)
- Epochs: 5
- Results: 12.59% F1 score
- Issue: Severe class imbalance, data leakage

**Improved Training** (In Progress):
- Dataset: FORGE (78,228 contracts) for training
- Test Set: SmartBugs (143 contracts) held-out
- Epochs: 20
- Strategy: Class-weighted loss + balanced sampling

### Training Configuration

**Hardware**: NVIDIA GPU (CUDA)
**Batch Size**: 4-8 (memory constrained)
**Optimizers**:
- Semantic encoder: AdamW (lr=0.0001, weight_decay=0.01)
- Other components: Adam (lr=0.001)

**Two-Phase Training**:

**Phase 1: Semantic Encoder Fine-tuning** (5-10 epochs)
- Freeze BERT layers initially
- Train only classification heads and projection
- Gradual unfreezing in later epochs
- Lower learning rate to preserve pre-training

**Phase 2: End-to-End Fusion** (10-20 epochs)
- Joint optimization of all components
- Different learning rates:
  - Static encoder: 0.0005
  - Dynamic encoder: 0.0005
  - Semantic encoder: 0.0001 (lower to preserve fine-tuning)
  - Fusion module: 0.001 (higher for faster adaptation)

### Class Imbalance Handling

**Problem**: Vulnerability types have very different frequencies

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Class-Weighted Loss**:
```python
weights = total_samples / (num_classes * class_counts)
criterion = CrossEntropyLoss(weight=weights)
```

2. **Balanced Sampling**:
```python
sample_weights = 1.0 / class_counts[labels]
sampler = WeightedRandomSampler(sample_weights)
```

Ensures each batch has balanced representation of all classes.

## Current Performance

### Baseline Results (October 30, 2025)

**Overall**: 12.59% F1 Score (18/143 detected)

**Per-Class Performance**:

| Vulnerability Type | Total | Detected | Missed | Rate | Status |
|-------------------|-------|----------|--------|------|--------|
| Access Control | 18 | 18 | 0 | 100.0% | ✅ Perfect |
| Arithmetic | 15 | 0 | 15 | 0.0% | ❌ Not learned |
| Bad Randomness | 8 | 0 | 8 | 0.0% | ❌ Not learned |
| Denial of Service | 6 | 0 | 6 | 0.0% | ❌ Not learned |
| Front Running | 4 | 0 | 4 | 0.0% | ❌ Not learned |
| Other | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0.0% | ❌ Not learned |
| Reentrancy | 31 | 0 | 31 | 0.0% | ❌ Not learned |
| Short Addresses | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0.0% | ❌ Not learned |
| Time Manipulation | 5 | 0 | 5 | 0.0% | ❌ Not learned |
| Unchecked Calls | 52 | 0 | 52 | 0.0% | ❌ Not learned |

**Analysis**:
- Model learned to always predict "access_control"
- 97% of predictions are access_control (139/143)
- Confidence scores all ~0.50 (essentially random)
- Clear evidence of severe class imbalance

**Speed**: 0.083 seconds/contract (12 contracts/second)

### Target Performance

**Goal**: 50-70% F1 Score after FORGE training

**Expected Per-Class** (based on validation accuracy):
- All classes: 40-60% detection rate
- High-frequency classes: 60-70%
- Low-frequency classes: 30-50%

   - Fixed with improved training script
   - Requires running FORGE training

3. **Data Leakage in Baseline**
   - Trained and tested on same 143 contracts
   - Not publishable as-is
   - Fixed by using FORGE for training

### Limitations

1. **Memory Constraints**
   - GraphCodeBERT is 493MB
   - Batch size limited to 4-8
   - Training slower than ideal

2. **PDG Extraction**
   - Requires Slither installation
   - Some contracts fail to parse
   - Fallback to simplified graphs

3. **Execution Traces**
   - Requires Mythril installation
   - Symbolic execution can be slow
   - Timeout on complex contracts

## Running the System

### Training

**Baseline** (for testing):
```bash
python scripts/train_triton.py \
  --train-dir data/datasets/smartbugs-curated/dataset \
  --output-dir models/checkpoints \
  --batch-size 4 \
  --num-epochs 5 \
  --learning-rate 0.001
```

**Improved** (recommended):
```bash
python scripts/train_triton_improved.py \
  --forge-dir data/datasets/FORGE-Artifacts/dataset \
  --output-dir models/checkpoints_improved \
  --batch-size 8 \
  --num-epochs 20 \
  --learning-rate 0.001 \
  --use-class-weights \
  --use-balanced-sampling
```

### Testing

**On SmartBugs**:
```bash
python scripts/test_triton.py \
  --dataset smartbugs \
  --output-dir results/test_run
```

**With Specific Checkpoints**:
```bash
# Modify TritonSystem.__init__ to specify checkpoint_dir
# Default: models/checkpoints
# Improved: models/checkpoints_improved
```

## Troubleshooting

### Models Not Loading

**Symptom**: Detection stays at 0% or logs show "Checkpoint directory not found"

**Solution**: Check that training completed and saved models:
```bash
ls -lh models/checkpoints/*.pt
```

Should see files like:
- semantic_encoder_epoch5.pt (493MB)
- fusion_module_epoch2_*.pt (38MB)
- static_encoder_epoch2_*.pt (22MB)
- dynamic_encoder_epoch2_*.pt (26MB)

### CUDA Out of Memory

**Symptom**: RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory

**Solution**: Reduce batch size:
```bash
--batch-size 2  # or even 1 if needed
```

### Training Stuck at Low Accuracy

**Symptom**: Validation accuracy stays below 20%

**Possible causes**:
1. Class imbalance - use improved training script
2. Too few epochs - increase to 20+
3. Learning rate too high/low - try 0.001, 0.0001
4. Data quality issues - check dataset loading
