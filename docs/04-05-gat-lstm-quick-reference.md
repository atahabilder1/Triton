# GAT & LSTM Quick Reference Card

## 🎯 One-Sentence Summary

**GAT** = Analyzes **relationships** (graph structure) | **LSTM** = Analyzes **sequences** (time order)

---

## 🔍 What They Do

### GAT (Graph Attention Network)
```
Input:  Code structure as a graph
Focus:  "What depends on what?"
Output: Structural vulnerability patterns
```

**Example**:
```
balance variable ──reads──> external_call ──before──> state_change
                                                        ↑
                                                   DANGER! ⚠️
```

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
```
Input:  Execution trace as a sequence
Focus:  "What happens when?"
Output: Temporal vulnerability patterns
```

**Example**:
```
Step 1: Read balance
Step 2: External call
Step 3: Update balance  ← DANGER! ⚠️ (wrong order)
```

## 🏗️ Simple Analogies

| Analogy | GAT (Static) | LSTM (Dynamic) |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Building** | Blueprint (structure) | People using it (behavior) |
| **Recipe** | Ingredients (dependencies) | Cooking steps (order) |
| **Crime** | Who knows whom (network) | Timeline of events (sequence) |
| **Chess** | Piece positions (board state) | Move sequence (game flow) |

## 📊 Visual Comparison

### GAT: Graph Structure
```
      ┌─────────┐
      │ balance │
      └────┬────┘
           │ reads
           ↓
      ┌─────────────┐
      │external_call│
      └──────┬──────┘
             │ before
             ↓
      ┌─────────────┐
      │state_change │  ⚠️ REENTRANCY
      └─────────────┘
```

### LSTM: Sequence Flow
```
Time:  t₁ ──────→ t₂ ──────→ t₃ ──────→ t₄
       │          │          │          │
Event: Check → External → Update → Exit
                 Call     Balance
                   │         │
                   └─────────┘
                  DANGER! ⚠️

## 🎓 For Your Thesis Defense

### When professor asks: "Why GAT?"
**Answer**: "GAT analyzes structural dependencies in code. It uses attention to focus on critical relationships like data flow between external calls and state changes, which are key indicators of reentrancy vulnerabilities."

### When professor asks: "Why LSTM?"
**Answer**: "LSTM captures temporal patterns in execution traces. It remembers past events to detect dangerous sequences, like updating state after an external call, which static analysis alone cannot detect."

### When professor asks: "Why both?"
**Answer**: "They're complementary. GAT catches structural vulnerabilities, LSTM catches temporal ones. Our fusion module (Contribution #2) intelligently combines both, achieving 92.5% F1-score versus 78% for static-only approaches."

## 🔬 Technical Quick Reference

### GAT in Triton
```python
# Location: encoders/static_encoder.py

Input:  PDG (Program Dependency Graph)
Layers: 3 GAT layers with multi-head attention
Output: 768-dimensional static feature vector

Purpose: Detect structural vulnerability patterns
```

### LSTM in Triton
```python
# Location: encoders/dynamic_encoder.py

Input:  Execution trace (sequence of events)
Layers: 2 bidirectional LSTM layers
Output: 512-dimensional dynamic feature vector

Purpose: Detect temporal vulnerability patterns
```

### Fusion
```python
# Location: fusion/cross_modal_fusion.py

Input:  GAT (768) + LSTM (512) + GraphCodeBERT (768)

Output: 768-dimensional fused feature vector

Purpose: Combine all perspectives intelligently
```

## 🎯 Key Differences

| Aspect | GAT | LSTM |
|--------|-----|------|
| **Input Type** | Graph (nodes + edges) | Sequence (ordered events) |
| **Processing** | Parallel (all nodes together) | Sequential (one event at a time) |
| **Memory** | None (stateless per layer) | Yes (remembers past events) |
| **Best For** | Dependencies, data flow | Order, timing, causality |
| **Speed** | Fast ⚡ | Slower 🐢 |
| **Coverage** | All possible paths | Executed paths only |

## 💡 Example: Reentrancy Detection

### Code:
```solidity
function withdraw() public {
    uint amt = balances[msg.sender];        // Line 1
    msg.sender.call{value: amt}("");        // Line 2 ⚠️
    balances[msg.sender] = 0;               // Line 3 ⚠️
}
```

### GAT Sees:
```
Line 1 (read balances) → Line 2 (external call)
                            ↓
                         Line 3 (write balances)

GAT's finding: "External call structurally depends on balance,
                and balance is modified after the call"
Confidence: 75%
```

### LSTM Sees:
```
Event sequence:
1. SLOAD balances[sender]
2. CALL external(amt)      ⚠️
3. SSTORE balances[sender] ⚠️

LSTM's finding: "Temporal pattern matches reentrancy:
                 Read → Call → Write"
Confidence: 80%
```

### Combined (Fusion):
```
Static (GAT):     75%
Dynamic (LSTM):   80%
Semantic (BERT):  70%

Final: 85% REENTRANCY DETECTED! 🚨
```

## 🎤 Elevator Pitch

"Smart contracts have two critical aspects: **structure** (what depends on what) and **behavior** (what happens when). We use **GAT** to analyze structure and **LSTM** to analyze behavior. By intelligently fusing both perspectives, we detect vulnerabilities that single-view tools miss."

**Time**: 30 seconds
**Impact**: Crystal clear!

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to implement GAT/LSTM from scratch?**
A: No! You're using PyTorch Geometric (GAT) and PyTorch (LSTM). Already implemented!

**Q: Do I need to tune GAT/LSTM parameters?**
A: Not necessarily. Default parameters often work. Training matters more than tuning.

**Q: Can I just use one of them?**
A: Yes, but you'll lose accuracy. Your novelty is combining both adaptively!

**Q: What if I don't understand the math?**
A: That's okay! Focus on **what** they do and **why** you combine them.
