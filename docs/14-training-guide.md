# Do I Need to Train My Triton Model?

## Quick Answer

**YES and NO** - It depends on what you want:

### For Basic Testing (NOW): ❌ No Training Needed
You can run tests **right now** without training. The system will use:
- Pre-trained GraphCodeBERT (from Microsoft)
- Untrained GAT layers (random initialization)
- Untrained LSTM layers (random initialization)
- Untrained fusion module (random initialization)

**Result**: The model will work but performance will be **lower than expected** (maybe 40-60% instead of the target 92.5%)

### For Target Performance (92.5% F1): ✅ Training Required
To achieve the 92.5% F1-score from your presentation, you need to:
1. Train the vulnerability-aware GraphCodeBERT fine-tuning
2. Train the GAT encoder on PDG patterns
3. Train the LSTM encoder on execution traces
4. Train the fusion module
5. Train the RL agent (agentic orchestrator)

## What's Currently Trainable in Your Code

### 1. GraphCodeBERT Fine-Tuning (Contribution #1)
**Location**: `encoders/semantic_encoder.py`

**Status**: Uses pre-trained `microsoft/graphcodebert-base`

**Needs Training**: YES - Fine-tune on vulnerability-specific patterns

**How to Train**:
```python

python train_semantic_encoder.py \
    --dataset smartbugs-curated \
    --epochs 10 \
    --learning-rate 2e-5 \
    --batch-size 8
```

**What It Learns**:

### 2. Static Encoder (GAT)
**Location**: `encoders/static_encoder.py`

**Status**: Random initialization

**Needs Training**: YES - Train on PDG graphs

**What It Learns**:
- Control flow patterns for vulnerabilities

- Adaptive attention weights

### 5. Agentic Orchestrator (Contribution #3)
**Location**: `orchestrator/agentic_workflow.py`

## Training Requirements

### Data Needed

1. **Labeled Vulnerability Dataset** ✅ (You have SmartBugs Curated - 143 contracts)
2. **Program Dependency Graphs (PDGs)** ⚠️ (Need to generate from contracts)
3. **Execution Traces** ⚠️ (Need to simulate or collect)
4. **CWE Labels** ✅ (Available in datasets)

### What You're Missing

To fully train Triton, you need:

1. **PDG Generator**: Convert Solidity contracts to PDGs
   - You have `utils/pdg_builder.py` but need to integrate with real PDG extraction
   - Consider using: Slither, Mythril, or custom parser

2. **Trace Collector**: Get execution traces
   - You have `utils/trace_collector.py` but need real trace generation
   - Consider using: Hardhat, Ganache, or symbolic execution

3. **Training Scripts**: Not created yet
   - `train.py` - Main training orchestrator
   - `train_semantic_encoder.py` - Fine-tune GraphCodeBERT
   - `train_fusion_module.py` - Train fusion weights
   - `train_rl_agent.py` - Train RL-based orchestrator

## What Happens If You Test Without Training?

### Current State (Untrained)

```
Expected Performance WITHOUT Training:
----------------------------------------
Precision: 40-60% (many false positives)
Recall: 30-50% (many false negatives)
F1-Score: 35-55% (far below target)
Reason: Random weights, no learned patterns
```

### After Training

```
Expected Performance WITH Training:
----------------------------------------
Precision: 90-95%
Recall: 90-95%
F1-Score: 92.5% (as per your presentation)
Reason: Learned patterns, optimized weights
```

---

## Can You Test Without Training? YES!

### Why Test Now (Before Training)?

1. **Verify System Works**: Check that all components run without errors
2. **Establish Baseline**: See how bad random initialization performs
3. **Debug Issues**: Find bugs before spending time on training
4. **Validate Architecture**: Ensure the multi-modal pipeline works

### What You'll See

When you run:
```bash
python scripts/test_triton.py --dataset smartbugs --output-dir results/smartbugs
```

**Without training**, you'll get output like:
```
VULNERABILITY DETECTION BREAKDOWN
====================================================================================================

Vulnerability Type              | Total    | Detected   | Missed   | Detection %
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reentrancy                      | 31       | 15         | 16       |      48.39%
Access Control                  | 18       | 8          | 10       |      44.44%
Arithmetic                      | 15       | 7          | 8        |      46.67%
...
TOTAL                           | 143      | 65         | 78       |      45.45%
```

**This is EXPECTED** without training! It proves the system runs.

## Training Roadmap (If You Want 92.5% F1)

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (You're Here!)
✅ Architecture implemented
✅ Datasets downloaded
✅ Testing infrastructure ready
⏳ Training infrastructure needed

### Phase 2: Data Preparation (Next Step)

2. Collect/simulate execution traces
3. Create train/val/test splits (70%/15%/15%)
4. Prepare labeled training data

### Phase 3: Component Training

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Test Now, Train Later (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Step 1: Test with untrained model (NOW)
./run_tests.sh
# Choose option 1: Test ALL SmartBugs Curated

# You'll get ~45% F1-score (baseline)

# Step 2: Create training scripts (LATER)
# Step 3: Train model (LATER)
# Step 4: Test again and compare (LATER)
```

**Advantage**:
- Verify everything works NOW
- Shows improvement after training
- Good for paper (compare trained vs. untrained)

### Option 2: Train First, Then Test
```bash
# Step 1: Create training infrastructure
# Step 2: Generate PDGs and traces
# Step 3: Train all components
# Step 4: Test on SmartBugs Curated

# You'll get ~92.5% F1-score (target)
```

**Advantage**:
- Shows target performance immediately
- More impressive results

**Disadvantage**:
- Takes weeks to set up training
- Might find bugs late in the process

---

## Minimal Training to Get Started

If you want **some** training without full infrastructure:

### Quick Fine-Tuning (1-2 days)

```python
# Just fine-tune GraphCodeBERT on vulnerability classification
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
from encoders.semantic_encoder import SemanticEncoder

# Load pre-trained model
encoder = SemanticEncoder("microsoft/graphcodebert-base")

# Fine-tune on SmartBugs Curated
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./models/semantic_encoder",
    num_train_epochs=5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    learning_rate=2e-5
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=encoder.model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=smartbugs_train,
    eval_dataset=smartbugs_val
)

trainer.train()
```

**Expected Improvement**: 45% → 65% F1-score (just from this!)
